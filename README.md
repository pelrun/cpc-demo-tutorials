Most of these are OCRed from various sources, mostly non-English. I've put a fair amount of effort into proofreading anything here, but it's definitely not perfect.

Google Translate does a surprisingly reasonable job on these (so far), but it does like incorrectly translating certain things. Here's a quick list:

- LAV: Actually VBL, for Vertical Blank.
- IVR: Invisible Vertical Rupture (RVI in the original)
- "line break line": Actually "line-by-line rupture".
